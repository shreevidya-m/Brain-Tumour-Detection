# Brain-Tumour-Detection
In my project titled Brain Tumor Detection Using Machine Learning, I developed a machine learning model that utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to detect brain tumors from MRI images.My solution automates the detection process, significantly improving both speed and accuracy, enabling more effective diagnosis.
